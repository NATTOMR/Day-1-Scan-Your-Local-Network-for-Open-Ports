 ## Install Nmap from official website
 - Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source network scanning tool used to discover devices, identify open ports, detect services and their versions, and gather information about operating systems on a network. It is widely used for network auditing, security assessments, and troubleshooting. Nmap allows users to do a bunch of things that are related to a wide range of network-related tasks.
